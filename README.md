#Algorithms & Data structures in C

Here are a few basic algorithms and data structures implemented in C. Most have some kind of documentation and tests, but I highly recommend you to proofread this with a copy of Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms or similar book.

##Data structures
- Vector
- Linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Stack
- Graph
- Trees
 - Heap
 - Binary tree
 - Binary search tree (BST)
 - AVL tree

##Algorithms
- Sorting
 - Heapsort
 - Mergesort
 - Heapsort
- Shortest path
 - Dijkstra's shortest path

## To-do list
- Data structures
 - Queue
 - Priority Queue
 - Set
 - Hash table
 - B-tree
 - Red-black tree
- Algorithms
 - Quicksort
 - Insertion sort
 - A* search
